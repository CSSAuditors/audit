      CSS Auditors have one mission—to put the CSS under the spotlight and educate developers about its importance.

      From file size to attributes and values, we try to find ways how to improve the way CSS could and should be written.

      The key part of our initiative is to make reports which would allow everyone to analyze how CSS is written.

      The reports we provide are generated by the script we wrote. The script will be available on GitHub soon.
